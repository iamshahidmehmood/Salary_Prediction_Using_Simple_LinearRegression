# Salary_Prediction_Using_Simple_LinearRegression
Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variable (X) and the response variable (Y) and tries to find the best-fit line that represents the relationship between the two variables.

The equation of the line is given by Y = mX + c, where m is the slope of the line, and c is the y-intercept. The goal of the regression analysis is to estimate the values of m and c that best fit the data.

Simple linear regression is used in various fields, such as finance, economics, marketing, and social sciences, to analyze the relationship between two variables and make predictions about future outcomes. It is also commonly used as a building block for more complex regression models.

The assumptions of simple linear regression include linearity, independence, homoscedasticity (equal variance), and normality of errors. These assumptions need to be checked before interpreting the results of the model.
